A ROS-wrapper for Bhoram Lee's GPisMap

The ROS package processes depth images from the ROS topic 
         "/sensor_d435_front/depth/image_rect_raw". 

It listens to two TF's to perform camera to world transform: "camera_depth_frame_front" to "map". 

The final output is a mesh file of the scene, covering space expressed in following matlab equivalent meshgrid definition.
    [xg, yg, zg ] = meshgrid( -0.5:0.02:1.5, -4.5:0.02:-2.5, -0.1:0.02:0.7 );

Please modify the image and TF names for different camera source, and change meshgrid definition for different scene setting.

To evaluate the ROS package, download a sample ROS bag at:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UwJbcTbjOckFaDoLaNXfEE1EI88kIkfW

1. run pre-recorded ROS-bag 
$ rosbag play 2020-04-17-22-51-55.bag -r 0.2

2. run GPisMap3
$ rosrun gpismp_ros gpismap3

3. trigger ONE mesh generation with ros service call
$ rosservice call /srv_mapper_update "{}"

4. check path <gpismap_ros>/mesh
There should be newly generated files with name pattern: pile_%02d.ply

5. To visualize generated mesh and/or cloud
$ roscd gpismap_ros
$ rosrun rviz rviz config/gpismap.rviz

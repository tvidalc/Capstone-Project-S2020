# Capstone-Project-S2020

ROS project for scanning architectural panels and various objects using GPIS algorithm. 

catkin_ws contains source code packages for robot control and Algorithm
thirdparty_ws contains all third party packages


Usage: 

1. Launch system to setup real robot, intel camera, and moveit nodes

    $ roslaunch robotic_sensing system_start.launch
    
2. Start robot server for sending motion commands 

    $ roslaunch robot_motion_server move_arm_server.launch
    
3. Initialise GPIS algorithm with commandline arguments stating whats being scanned. panel option does a single scan from top view while object option obtains mutliple views

    $ rosrun gpismap_ros gpismap3 _command:=panel   or   rosrun gpismap_ros gpismap3 _command:=object
    
4. perform a service call to start algorithm and robot server

    $ rosservice call /srv_mapper_update "{}"
    
5. allow system to run and auto terminate else for any issues hit ctrl-z on all terminals to cancel processes


Note: All commands must be entered in a new terminal
